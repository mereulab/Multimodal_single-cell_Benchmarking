# Benchmark framework & mBDRC dataset
This repository contains the code for reproducibility of results in our publication: (["Systematic evaluation of single-cell multimodal data integration for comprehensive human reference atlas"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.06.637075v1)). Using the human kidney as a model for a complex tissue, we generated a unique benchmarking dataset for the multimodal characterization of renal cortex by integrating 3' and 5' scRNA-seq, with joint snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data, encompassing 119,744 high-quality nuclei/cells from 18 donors.

Following depicted guidelines we generated a unique multimodal benchmarking dataset for renal cortex characterization (mBDRC). In house developed interpretable machine learning tool for reference-based cell-type classification, scOMM ([single-cell Omics Multimodal Mapping](https://github.com/mereulab/scOMM)), has been used to anchor mBDRC to previous human kidney references to produce two layer of annotation. This dataset will be accessible in the CZ CELLxGENE Discover platform.
